# iTrackerReef
A python app designed to allow a user to communicate with those around them and access music using only slight head movements. Uses OpenCV among other libraries to use
a computer's camera to track the user's head, and depending on how their position changes over a short interval of time, a command will be issued to the app. This was 
designed for a client with limited motor control, who wants to be able to communicate computer-voiced messages and play YouTube links independently. 

Move the head slightly to the right to scroll to the next option. Move the head slightly upwards to use the current option.
